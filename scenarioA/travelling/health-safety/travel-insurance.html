  During a short vacation on a Caribbean island, a Canadian developed a severe form of pneumonia and had to be admitted to hospital. His health deteriorated, and he was transferred to intensive care and placed on a breathing machine for more than a month. Without insurance, he had to make arrangements with the hospital to pay a bill that amounted to more than $20,000. </div>

<h2>Why you should buy travel health insurance&nbsp;</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Your Canadian health insurance is generally not valid outside Canada</li>
	<li>Your provincial or territorial health plan may cover nothing or only a small part of the costs of medical care abroad, and will never pay bills up front</li>
	<li>Foreign hospitals can be very expensive, and may require immediate cash payment</li>
	<li>In some countries hospitals and clinics refuse to treat patients who do not have enough insurance or money to pay their bills</li>
	<li>The Government of Canada will not pay your medical bills</li>
</ul>

<h2>What travel health insurance should cover&nbsp;</h2>

	  <h3>Medical evacuation</h3>
	  <p>Make sure the policy covers medical evacuation to Canada or to the nearest location with appropriate medical care. The policy should also cover the costs of a medical escort to accompany you to your final destination.</p>

	  <h3>Pre-existing medical conditions</h3>
	  <p>Ask the company to explain the definition, limitations and restrictions of any pre-existing conditions and tests and treatments you may have undergone.</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">Make sure you get a written agreement that your pre-existing medical condition is covered, or you could find your claim “null and void” under a pre-existing condition clause. </span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">Be aware that the agreement must also include a stability clause stating that for you to be covered for any pre-existing medical conditions you must have no changes to or new medical conditions, symptoms or medications during the stability period prior to your trip.</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">The agreement should include a compassion clause stating that an inaccurate statement may not invalidate the entire policy, and a change of health clause.</span></li>
</ul>

	<h3>Repatriation in case of death</h3>
	<p>Verify that the plan covers the preparation and return of your remains to Canada.</p>

	  <h2>Know what you're buying</h2>
	  <p>Carefully research your needs. Verify the terms, conditions, limitations, exclusions and requirements of your insurance policy before you leave Canada.</p>

	  <p>When assessing a travel health insurance plan, you should ask a lot of questions.</p>
	  <ul>
		  <li>Is there a deductible, and how much is it?</li>
<li>Does the plan provide continuous coverage for the duration of your stay abroad and after you return?</li>
<li>Does it offer coverage that is renewable from abroad and for the maximum period of stay?</li>
<li>Does the company have an in-house, worldwide, 24-hour/7-day emergency contact number in English and/or translation services for health care providers in your destination country?</li>
<li>Does it pay for foreign hospitalization for illness or injury and related medical costs?</li>
<li>Does it provide up-front payment of bills or cash advances, so you don’t have to pay out of your own pocket?</li>
	  </ul>

<h2>Meet the terms of your policy</h2>
<p>It is your responsibility to know and understand the terms of your insurance policy. Read the fine print carefully and ask for help, if necessary.</p>
<p>The information you provide must be accurate and complete. If you have any questions, contact the insurance company. Ask them to clarify the issue in writing.</p>
<p>Get approval from your insurer before undergoing medical treatment. Travel health insurance rarely covers routine health checkups, non-emergency care and cosmetic surgery. Insurance companies may also exclude coverage for mental health disorders, drug- or alcohol-related incidents, or extreme sporting activities such as bungee jumping and rock climbing.</p>
<p>Get a detailed report and invoice from the doctor or hospital before leaving the country where you have received medical treatment. There is nothing more frustrating than trying to get the proper paperwork from thousands of kilometres away. Always submit the original receipts for medical services or prescriptions you received abroad. Keep a copy of the documents for your files.</p>
<p>Carry details of your insurance policy and tell your travel agent, a travel companion, and a friend or relative at home how to contact your insurer.</p>
 <h2>Check for travel advisories</h2>
	<p>Your insurance company may not honour medical claims if the Government of Canada has advised that you should avoid travel to that destination.</p>
	  <p>Check the advice about your destination in advance, and check again just before you go.</p>
	  <p><a href="https://gc-proto.github.io/travel-advice/scenarioA/travelling/advisories.html">Destination advice and advisories</a></p>

	  <h2>Where you can get travel insurance</h2>
	<p>You can buytravel insurance through your travel agent, insurance broker or your employer’s insurance provider. Your credit card company may also offer travel and health insurance.</p>


	  <h2>Travel safe</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Carry details of your insurance policy and tell your travel agent, a travel companion, and a friend or relative at home how to contact your insurer</li>
	<li><a href="https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/registration">Register with us</a>, and include your insurance policy details, such as the name of the insurance provider and policy number when signing up</li>
	<li>Check the <a href="http://travel.gc.ca/travelling/advisories">destination advice and advisories</a> twice for each destination as it could affect your insurance coverage</li>
	<li>Call the nearest <strong>Canadian embassy or consulate</strong> for emergency assistance or reach the Emergency Watch and Response Centre 24/7 by telephone at +1 613 996-8885 (call collect where available) or email at <strong>sos@international.gc.ca</strong></li>
	  </ul>

		if you get sick or are injured while abroad. For more information, contact your&nbsp;<a href="http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/hcs-sss/delivery-prestation/ptrole/index-eng.php">provincial or territorial health authority</a>. Hospitals and clinics in some countries have been known to refuse to treat patients who become ill or who have had an accident and who do not have adequate travel health insurance or the money to pay their bills. You could face years of debt paying off the costs of treatment for an illness or accident you suffered abroad. The Government of Canada will not pay your medical bills.</p>

<div class="panel-body">Young travellers may think they don’t need insurance because they’re young and healthy. But accidents do happen. While walking along a beach on a Caribbean island, a Canadian tourist in her early 20s had an accident that seriously damaged her spine. Her family had to raise funds to pay for her medical evacuation.</div>

<!-- START ti_travel_advisories -->
<!--
<h2>Travel advisories and insurance policies</h2>
<p>No matter where in the world you intend to travel, make sure you check the&nbsp;<a href="http://travel.gc.ca/travelling/advisories">Travel Advice and Advisories</a>&nbsp;twice, once when you are planning your trip and again shortly before you leave. If a Travel Advisory is issued for your destination, after you make your travel arrangements but before or during your trip, it may affect your travel health insurance or trigger your trip cancellation insurance. Make sure you understand any terms and conditions in the policy in regard to travel advice and advisories from the Government of Canada.</p>

<p>Some insurance companies will not honour medical claims made for injuries suffered in a country for which the Government of Canada has issued an official&nbsp;<a href="http://travel.gc.ca/travelling/advisories">Travel Advisory</a>.&nbsp;Coverage for injuries resulting from war may also be limited. Insurance policies often have exclusion clauses stipulating regions and/or activities that will not be covered.</p>

<p><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">And ensure that the plan provides for medical evacuation to Canada or the nearest location with appropriate medical care and pays for a medical escort (health care provider) to accompany you to and from your destination.</span></p>
<p>Ensure that deductible costs are clearly explained in the plan. Plans with 100-percent coverage are more expensive but may save money in the long run. The plan could cover health care provider visits and prescription medicines, or emergency dental care or emergency transportation, such as ambulance services. Check whether it excludes or significantly limits coverage for certain regions or countries you may visit.</p>
<p>Finally, ensure that the plan covers the preparation and return of your remains to Canada if you die abroad.</p>

<div class="panel-body">Gabrielle had insurance that lapsed three weeks before she was involved in an accident. Her Canadian family had to raise $300,000 over a three-day period to cover the costs of medical treatment and evacuation. Fortunately, she survived, but her family is left with a hefty debt to repay.</div>
