      	<h3>Crime</h3><p>The rate of drug-related violent crimes, including homicides, is on the rise in Costa Rica. Drug trafficking is common. Local drug use, including crack, is a major concern.</p><h4>Violent crime</h4><p>Violent crime against foreigners, though not frequent, is a concern. Incidents of armed robberies, carjackings and home invasions have occurred in beach areas and on the main highways in the Central Valley region, even in daylight. Violent assaults against Canadians have occurred in Puerto Lim&oacute;n and Puerto Viejo.</p><ul><li>Do not walk alone after dusk or at dawn</li><li>Avoid remote or isolated areas, including roads and trails</li><li>If you are threatened by armed criminals, do as they ask without hesitation, as resisting may result in the escalation of violence</li></ul><h4>Express kidnapping</h4><p>Cases of express kidnapping, where victims are picked up from the street and forced to withdraw funds from ABMs, have occurred, sometimes at gunpoint.</p>
        <h4>Petty crime</h4>
        <p>Petty crime&mdash;including pickpocketing and bag snatching&mdash;occurs frequently. Tourists are common targets for theft because they are perceived as being wealthy.</p><p>Cases of passport theft are extremely common and increase in frequency during the peak tourist seasons, from November to May and from July to August.</p><ul><li>Stay alert and be aware of your surroundings</li><li>Avoid isolated areas and never walk alone at night</li><li>Avoid showing signs of affluence and never leave valuables such as money, credit cards, jewellery, cell phones and other electronics unattended, especially on beaches</li><li>Don&rsquo;t carry large amounts of cash and use caution at automated banking machines (ABMs)</li></ul><p>Ensure that your personal belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, are secure at all times</p><p>Carry a photocopy of the identification page of your passport, including the Costa Rican entry stamp, with you at all times.</p><p>Foreigners are often victims of theft on buses and at bus stations, airports, ports, crowded tourist attractions, restaurants and resort areas. Thieves often work in teams, in which one thief diverts the victims&rsquo; attention while the other snatches their possessions.</p><ul><li>When travelling by public bus, avoid placing personal belongings in the overhead compartment or under your seat.</li><li>Keep your bag with valuables and identification in your lap.</li><li>Stay at hotels and rental houses that have security measures such as guards and security cameras.</li><li>Always lock your doors, even while in the room or if you leave for a few minutes.</li><li>Don&rsquo;t leave valuables in plain sight</li></ul><p>Exercise particular caution in the capital, San Jos&eacute;. High-risk areas for theft include:</p><ul><li>the Coca Cola bus terminal (near the Zona Roja or red light district)</li><li>the inner downtown area and public parks</li></ul><h4>Caribbean coast</h4><p>On the Caribbean coast, be particularly vigilant in Lim&oacute;n province towns of:</p><ul><li>Cahuita</li><li>Puerto Lim&oacute;n (its port areas)</li><li>Puerto Viejo.</li></ul><h4>Pacific coast</h4><p>In Puntarenas province, &nbsp;the following areas are of particular concern for theft:</p><ul><li>Dominical</li><li>Jac&oacute;</li><li>Manuel Antonion</li><li>Quepos</li><li>Cobano area, including Mal Pa&iacute;s, Montezuma and Santa Teresa, and the port of Puntarenas.</li></ul><p>Cars parked near the popular crocodile viewing area along the T&aacute;rcoles River near Jac&oacute; are particularly vulnerable to theft when a designated police patrol car is not on site.</p><h4>Theft from vehicles</h4><p>Theft from vehicles is very common, especially at hotels, supermarkets, restaurants, store lots, national parks and beaches.</p><p>The theft of rental cars is also common throughout the country. Thieves know the makes and models of rental cars, making them easy targets.</p><ul><li>Don&rsquo;t leave your passport or your valuables in the car, even if you leave the car for only a few minutes</li><li>Park your vehicle in supervised <i>parqueos p&uacute;blicos</i> (public parking lots)</li><li>Keep your windows up and doors locked at all times</li><li>Beware of &ldquo;good Samaritans&rdquo; offering to help change a flat tire. Calmly refuse their help and contact Costa Rican authorities and, if you rented the car, the rental agency.</li><li>Don&rsquo;t stop to change a flat tire in an isolated area, and keep the doors of the vehicle locked while changing a tire</li><li>Ensure an emergency assistance is offered by the rental agency when renting a car</li></ul><h4>Fraud</h4><p>Credit card fraud is a growing problem.</p><h3>Women&rsquo;s safety</h3><p>Incidents of sexual assault against foreigners at beach resorts and by taxi drivers in San Jos&eacute; have been reported. The risk increases for women travelling alone and they may be subject to some forms of harassment and verbal abuse.</p><p><a href="https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/publications/her-own-way">Safe-travel guide for women</a></p><h3>Spiked food and drinks</h3><p>Never leave food or drinks unattended or in the care of strangers. Be wary of accepting snacks, beverages, gum or cigarettes from new acquaintances. These items may contain drugs that could put you at risk of sexual assault and robbery.</p><h3>Demonstrations</h3><p>Demonstrations take place from time to time, particularly in San Jos&eacute;. Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.</p><p>Costa Rica&rsquo;s constitution prohibits political activity by foreigners; such actions may result in detention or deportation.</p><ul><li>Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place</li><li>Follow the instructions of local authorities</li><li>Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations</li></ul><p><a href="http://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/mass-gatherings">More about mass gatherings (large-scale events)</a></p><!-- START Road safety --><h3>Road safety</h3><p>Costa Rica has one of the highest traffic accident rates in the world. In some areas, potholes, sharp curves, lack of traffic signs, landslides and narrow or unpaved roads create dangerous road conditions. Driving conditions may be hazardous during the rainy season.</p><p>Exercise great caution when driving or walking, as drivers don&rsquo;t respect traffic laws. Be careful after dark, especially on rural roads, as motorists often drive without lights at night.</p><p>Remain vigilant when stopped at lights or stop signs, and always drive with the doors locked and windows closed. Keep your valuables out of plain sight when driving and avoid travel at night to reduce the risk of becoming a victim of crime.</p><p>If you are involved in a car accident:</p><ul><li>call 911 to notify authorities</li><li>inform the car rental agency, if applicable</li><li>don&rsquo;t move the vehicle until advised to do so by the police</li></ul><p>See <a href="https://travel.gc.ca/destinations-print/costa-rica#laws">Laws and culture </a>for more information.</p><!-- END Road safety --><h3>Public transportation</h3><p>Public bus transportation is unreliable. Police checks of passengers on public transportation occur and are often used to determine whether foreigners have overstayed the 90-day visa exemption period.</p><h4>Taxis</h4><p>Only use official radio-dispatched taxis (orange taxis at the airport and red taxis with a yellow triangle on the side elsewhere in the country).</p><ul><li>make sure the driver&rsquo;s ID is clearly visible on the dashboard and that the driver uses the meter</li><li>avoid taxis that do not have working door handles, locks and meters</li><li>don&rsquo;t ride in the front seat with the driver</li></ul><h3>Maritime travel</h3><p>If navigating the coasts, proceed with caution, as safety and rescue operations are limited due to a lack of resources.</p><h3>Air travel</h3><p>We do not make assessments on the compliance of foreign domestic airlines with international safety standards.</p><p><a href="http://travel.gc.ca/air/foreign-domestic-airlines">General information about foreign domestic airlines</a></p><h3>Swimming</h3><p>Riptides are common. Several drownings occur each year.</p><p>Very few beaches are supervised with lifeguards or have signs warning of dangerous conditions.</p><ul><li>Never swim alone</li><li>Seek the advice of local authorities before venturing into the water</li></ul><p>The Costa Rican Tourism Bureau provides important advice on safety matters, such as swimming in the ocean and avoiding crocodiles.</p><p><a href="http://www.visitcostarica.com/en">Costa Rican Tourism Bureau</a></p><h3>Adventure tourism</h3><p>White-water rafting, scuba diving, bungee jumping, canopy touring and other adventure sports should only be undertaken with a well-established company that has insurance. Safety features on small boats are not always reliable. If you have any doubt concerning the safety of the installation or equipment, refrain from using them.</p><ul><li>Ensure that the recreational activities you choose are covered by your travel insurance.</li><li>Never walk or hike alone..</li><li>Avoid camping or sleeping overnight on beaches.</li><li>If you intend to visit jungle areas, always go with an experienced and reputable guide.</li></ul><h4>National parks</h4><p>The Costa Rican government requires all visitors to national parks to register their entry with the National Park Service and to obtain a permit to enter the park. Life-threatening fauna such as jaguars, pumas, wild pigs and poisonous snakes are common in some parks, especially in the densely wooded areas</p><h3>General security information</h3><p>&nbsp;Few services outside major hotels are available in English (or French). Most taxi drivers, police officers, lawyers and hospital workers don&rsquo;t speak English (or French).</p>

        <p>Before you travel, check with your transportation company about passport requirements. Its rules on passport validity may be more stringent than the country&rsquo;s entry rules.</p>
        <h4>Regular Canadian passport</h4>
        <p>Your passport must be valid to visit Costa Rica. In order to avoid unexpected delays, we recommend that your passport be valid for at least 1 month beyond the date of your expected departure from Costa Rica.</span>

        	or through the Embassy of Costa Rica in Canada prior to departure. There have been several cases of departure denials because proper documentation was lacking. Minors with dual citizenship who are travelling unaccompanied must have legally certified
