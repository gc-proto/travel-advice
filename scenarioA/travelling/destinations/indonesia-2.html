              <h2 id="security">Safety and security</h2>
                  <h3>Papua </h3><p>There has been ongoing political tension and regular violent occurrences since October 2011. In some cases, foreigners and foreign businesses have been targeted by local militants.</p><p>There is a heightened police and military presence in Papua. Labour disputes at the Freeport-McMoRan mine near Timika have led to demonstrations, transportation disruptions and violence. Fatal attacks have occurred on roads near the mine.</p><h3>Terrorism</h3><p>There is a threat of terrorism in Indonesia. While effective counterterrorism measures by Indonesian authorities are in place, terrorist cells are active and have the capacity to carry out attacks anywhere in the country.</p><p>In May 2018, bomb attacks occurred in three churches and one police station in Surabaya (Indonesia&rsquo;s second largest city). The explosions caused many casualties.</p><p>Further attacks are likely and could take place anywhere in the country. Targets could include:</p><ul><li>government buildings, including schools</li><li>police and military installations and personnel</li><li>places of worship</li><li>airports and other transportation hubs and networks</li><li>public areas such as tourist attractions, restaurants, bars, coffee shops, shopping centres, markets, hotels, and other sites frequented by foreigners.</li></ul><p>Stay at hotels that have robust security measures, including metal detectors, guards and security cameras. Keep in mind, however, that even the most secure locations cannot be considered completely free of risk.</p><p>Be particularly vigilant during religious holidays and other public celebrations, as terrorists have used such occasions to mount attacks.</p><ul><li>Always be aware of your surroundings when in public places and identify ways to leave the area in case of emergency</li><li>Monitor local media</li><li>Follow the instructions of the local authorities</li></ul><h3>Crime</h3><p>Armed robberies occur regularly. Petty crime, including pickpocketing, bag snatching and forced cash withdrawals from ATMs, is a serious concern. There is a high risk of street crime, pick-pocketing and bag-snatching in tourist areas, such as Bali and Lombok, and foreign tourists are targeted. Tourists travelling alone, women and those travelling at night are at particular risk.</p><p>Keep car doors locked and windows rolled up at all times. Use reputable taxis from major hotels or book in advance by phone. Standards of police and legal services differ considerably from those in Canada.&nbsp;</p><p>Merchants do not always honour pricing agreements. Use good judgment in engaging services of tourist guides, especially in places that tourists rarely visit.</p><h3>Demonstrations and civil unrest</h3><p>Large protests have taken place in many parts of the country over a wide range of issues, causing significant disruptions to traffic and public transportation. Sporadic ethnic and religious tensions in areas of Indonesia have resulted in violence and civil unrest.</p><p>Avoid all demonstrations, rallies and gatherings, as they can turn violent with little notice. Monitor local news and follow the instructions of local authorities.</p><h3>Political and social tension</h3><p>There are long-standing sectarian and social tensions throughout Indonesia, particularly in the provinces of Central Sulawesi (especially in Palu, Poso and Tentena), Maluku (especially in Ambon) and West Papua.</p><p>Sectarian violence targeting civilians has occurred. While there are ongoing security operations by Indonesian authorities, the potential for violence remains. Exercise a high degree of personal security awareness at all times, maintain a heightened level of vigilance and be aware of your surroundings.</p><h3>Kidnapping</h3><p>Foreigners have been kidnapped and killed in the past, particularly in the province of Aceh. Avoid travelling alone and travelling at night throughout Indonesia.</p><h4>East and West Kalimantan</h4><p>The Philippines-based Abu Sayyaf terrorist group has kidnapped tourists from Sabah, Malaysia, and the Philippines. Abu Sayyaf has not extended its activities into neighbouring coastal areas of Indonesia, including East Kalimantan, but may be capable of doing so.</p><h3>Spiked food and drinks</h3><p>Never leave food or drinks unattended or in the care of strangers. People have died after consuming drinks contaminated with methanol. Be wary of accepting snacks, beverages, gum or cigarettes from new acquaintances. These items may contain drugs that could put you at risk of sexual assault and robbery.</p><h3>Fraud</h3><p>There is a very high rate of credit and debit card fraud in Indonesia, including online fraud. Keep your card information (number, name, expiry date) private. Keep all receipts and bills bearing a credit or debit card number secure or destroy them completely.</p><p>&nbsp;Be cautious when using debit or credit cards:</p><ul><li>pay careful attention when your card is handled by others</li><li>use ATMs located in well-lit public areas or inside a bank or business</li><li>avoid using card readers with an irregular or unusual feature</li><li>cover the keypad with one hand when entering your PIN</li><li>check for any unauthorized transactions on your account statements</li></ul><p><a href="http://www.voyage.gc.ca/countries_pays/issues_enjeux/article-eng.asp?id=1090">More about overseas fraud</a></p><!-- START Road safety --><h3>Road safety</h3><p>Many remote parts of Indonesia have poor transportation networks. It may be difficult or impossible to leave these areas in a crisis.</p><p>Road conditions, particularly outside major centres, are poor. Road travel in Indonesia can be very challenging, as drivers are not disciplined and do not consistently obey traffic rules. Streets are generally congested. Driving at night in rural areas is dangerous, as most rural roads are unlit and some drivers do not use lights. If you plan to rent a car, consider hiring a driver.</p><p>Be particularly cautious on the road from Banda Aceh to Medan, where armed robberies have occurred. There is a possibility of mob anger if an accident has caused serious injury. In such cases, remain in your vehicle and drive to the nearest police station to report the accident.</p><p>Motorcycle and scooter accidents are the main cause of death and serious injury among foreigners visiting many parts of Indonesia, including Bali. Be aware of scams involving motorcycles rentals. Rental motorcycles are targeted and stolen and the renters are left to pay the replacement cost for a new motorcycle.</p><!-- END Road safety --><h3>Public transportation</h3><p>Transport by bus and rail can be crowded and safety standards are poor.</p><h3>Maritime transportation</h3><p>Avoid travelling by ferry. Maritime accidents are common and are often caused by poor safety practices or extreme weather conditions. Do not board vessels that appear overloaded or unseaworthy.&nbsp;If you choose to travel by ferry, ensure that the vessel you are boarding is carrying appropriate safety equipment, that life jackets are provided for all passengers and that they are accessible at all times. Verify the safety standards of ferries with your tour operator.</p><h3>Air travel</h3><p>We do not make assessments on the compliance of foreign domestic airlines with international safety standards.</p><p><a href="http://travel.gc.ca/air/foreign-domestic-airlines">General information about foreign domestic airlines</a></p><h3>Swimming</h3><p>Rough seas and strong currents have led to drownings. Respect local warnings and consult hotel management about potential water hazards.</p><h3>Piracy</h3><p>Pirate attacks occur in coastal waters and, in some cases, farther out at sea. Mariners should take appropriate precautions.</p><p><a href="https://icc-ccs.org/index.php/piracy-reporting-centre">Live piracy report</a> - International Maritime Bureau&rsquo;s Piracy Reporting Centre<span></span></p><h3>General safety information</h3><p>Ensure that your personal belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, are secure at all times. Exercise caution at all times and in all places.</p>

        	<p>Indonesia is located in an active seismic zone and is prone to a multitude of natural disasters such as earthquakes, tsunamis, flooding, volcanic eruptions and drought.</p><h3>Earthquakes and tsunamis</h3><p>Each year, Indonesia experiences thousands of earthquakes of varying magnitudes, some triggering tsunamis. Deaths, injuries and significant damage occasionally occur.</p><section class="alert alert-warning"><h3><p>Tsunami in the Sunda Strait</p></h3><p>On December 22, 2018, a tsunami hit the districts of Pandeglang and Serang, in the province of Banten, and the districts of South Lampung, Tanggamus, and Pesawaran, in the province of Lampung. The tsunami caused many casualties, as well as important damage to infrastructure, including hotels and restaurants. Monitor local media for the latest developments and follow the instructions of local authorities.</p></section><section class="alert alert-warning"><h3><p>Earthquake in Sulawesi Central</p></h3><p>On September 28, 2018, a 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck the central region of the island of Sulawesi, affecting the capital city of Palu and fishing village of Donggala. The earthquake caused many casualties, as well as widespread damage to infrastructure and roads throughout the region. Disruptions to essential services continue. Monitor local media for the latest developments and follow the instructions of local authorities.</p></section><h3>Volcanic activity</h3><p>Indonesia has 129 active volcanoes and periodically experiences major volcanic events. The Indonesian Directorate of Volcanology monitors active volcanoes to ensure that residents are provided with an early warning should unusual activity occur. Alert levels can be raised and evacuations ordered on short notice. Volcanic events can be dangerous, even life-threatening. Ash clouds can disrupt air travel, including on the island of Bali, and cause or worsen respiratory problems.</p><section class="alert alert-warning"><h3><p>Anak Krakatau volcano</p></h3><p>Due to an increase in the seismic activity of the Anak Krakatau volcano, the Indonesian authorities raised the risk level to 3 out of 4 on December 27, 2018. They also increased the exclusion zone around the volcano to 5 km and asked travellers to avoid the Sunda Strait between the islands of Java and Sumatra.</p></section><p>Keep up to date with any developments if you are travelling close to active volcanoes and follow the instructions of local authorities. Take official warnings seriously and respect exclusion zones. Consult the Geological Agency of the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources and National Disaster Management Authority&nbsp;for a list of volcanoes with elevated risk levels.</p><ul><li><a href="http://www.vsi.esdm.go.id/index.php">Geological Agency of the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources</a><b>&nbsp;</b>(Bahasa Indonesia, only)</li><li><a href="https://www.bnpb.go.id/en">National Disaster Management Authority</a></li><li><a href="https://magma.vsi.esdm.go.id/">Map of active volcanoes in Indonesia &ndash; MAGMA Indonesia</a></li></ul><h3>Rainy season</h3><p>The rainy season extends from November to March, but heavy rains are common throughout the year. Flooding and landslides can occur with little warning, especially in remote areas where extensive deforestation is common, but also in major cities, including Jakarta. Such incidents have led to fatalities and destruction of property. Keep informed of regional weather forecasts as well as road closures or detours, avoid disaster areas and follow the advice of local authorities.</p><p><a href="https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/large-scale-emergencies-abroad/hurricanes-typhoons-cyclones-monsoons">More about hurricanes, typhoons, cyclones and monsoons</a></p><h3>Atmospheric pollution</h3><p>Unrestricted burning in Sumatra and Kalimantan periodically causes atmospheric pollution (haze) to rise to unhealthy levels, especially from June to October. Monitor levels closely, as they change quickly.</p>
