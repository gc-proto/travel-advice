      <li>Proof of yellow fever vaccination is required if coming from certain countries - <a href="#vax">When yellow fever vaccination is required</a></li>
    </ul>

  <h2 id="safety">Safety and security</h2>
  <h3>Crime</h3><p>Violent robberies and petty crime, such as pickpocketing, mugging and bag-snatching, occur. Criminals target tourists in particular in the following areas:</p><ul><li>Kenyatta Drive in Blantyre</li><li>walking between Lilongwe&rsquo;s Old Town and Capital City districts</li><li>the main bus stations in Lilongwe and Blantyre</li><li>the main ports for the Ilala ferry</li></ul><p>In fall 2017, there were two separate violent attacks on visitors to the Mount Mulanje area. If you intend to visit the area, be extremely vigilant and ensure that you hire an experienced and reputable local guide. Contact the Mountain Club of Malawi for security advice before climbing Mount Mulanje.</p><p>Residential break-ins and carjackings are prevalent throughout the country. Organized robberies and attacks by gangsters occur and may target foreigners. Carjackings often occur when a vehicle is stopped, for example, when waiting to enter at a compound vehicle gate, at intersections or in traffic.</p><p>Avoid walking alone at night.</p><p>Exercise great caution, especially on buses, at bus stops and while hiking, or when approached by persons who wish to befriend you, help you or become your tour guide. Do not leave your luggage unattended.</p><p>Do not show signs of affluence. Ensure that your personal belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, are secure at all times.</p><h3>Fraud</h3><p>Con artists are active in major cities and tourist destinations such as:</p><ul><li>Blantyre</li><li>Cape Maclear</li><li>Mzuzu</li><li>Nkhata Bay</li><li>Senga Bay&nbsp;</li><li>Zomba&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul><h3>Women&rsquo;s Safety</h3><p>In Malawi&rsquo;s capital, Lilongwe, as well as in Blantyre, Mzuzu and Zomba, men have attacked women wearing pants, leggings and short skirts. They also stripped and robbed the women. Women travellers in these areas should avoid wearing close-fitting clothing and be aware of their surroundings.</p><p>Throughout the country, women travelling alone may be subject to some forms of harassment and verbal abuse.</p><p><a href="https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/publications/her-own-way">Safe-travel guide for women</a></p><h3>Demonstrations</h3><p>Demonstrations may occur. Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.</p><ul><li>Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place</li><li>Follow the instructions of local authorities</li><li>Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations</li></ul><p><a href="http://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/mass-gatherings">More about mass gatherings (large-scale events)</a><span></span></p><!-- START Road safety --><h3>Road safety</h3><p>The traffic-related death rate is high. Poor road conditions, poorly maintained vehicles and inadequate street lighting make driving dangerous. Potholes, pedestrians, animals, abandoned vehicles and vehicles travelling at night without lights also pose risks. Avoid driving outside cities after dark. Emergency roadside assistance is very limited.</p><p>Armed carjackings, particularly of four-wheel-drive vehicles, have occurred. You should not resist if threatened by carjackers. Always wear seat belts. Keep windows closed and doors locked and never leave your personal belongings in a vehicle.</p><p>Hitchhiking or taking matola (informal lifts in the back of open vehicles) is considered dangerous.</p><!-- END Road safety --><h3>Public transportation</h3><p>Public transport is limited in rural areas. There are regular flights and bus services among Blantyre, Lilongwe, Mzuzu and Zomba. Travel by minibus between cities is not recommended, as the vehicles are overcrowded and poorly maintained.</p><h3>Spiked food and drinks</h3><p>Never leave food or drinks unattended or in the care of strangers. Be wary of accepting snacks, beverages, gum or cigarettes from new acquaintances. These items may contain drugs that could put you at risk of sexual assault and robbery.</p><h3>General safety information</h3><p>Tourist facilities are limited outside of major centres.</p><h3>Reserves and safaris</h3><p>There are inherent risks associated with viewing wildlife (both marine and on land), particularly on foot or at close range. Always maintain a safe distance when observing wildlife and avoid leaving the vehicle unless it is deemed safe to do so by professional guides and wardens. Use only reputable and professional guides or tour operators, and closely follow park regulations and wardens&rsquo; advice.</p><h3>Air travel</h3><p>We do not make assessments on the compliance of foreign domestic airlines with international safety standards.</p><p><a href="http://travel.gc.ca/air/foreign-domestic-airlines">General information about foreign domestic airlines</a></p>
