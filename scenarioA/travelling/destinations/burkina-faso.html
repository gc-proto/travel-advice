				<li>A permit is required for photography <br><a title="" href="#laws">Laws and culture</a></li>
			</ul>


			<h2>Safety and security</h2>
			<h3>Northern area</h3>
			<p>The threat of kidnapping persists in Burkina Faso&rsquo;s northern area, due to the proximity of Mali and Niger, where criminal and terrorist groups are active. Should you plan to go to these areas despite the advisory:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>be vigilant at all times</li>
				<li>use varied and unpredictable routes and itineraries</li>
				<li>use an armed security escort</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Border regions</h3>
			<p>The threat of banditry and kidnapping is high in Burkina Faso&rsquo;s border regions, especially along its northern border with Mali, and along the northern portion of its border with Niger.</p>
			<div class="alert alert-warning"><span><p>On December 31, 2018, Burkinabe authorities declared a state of emergency in several regions along the borders with Mali, Niger, Benin and Togo. Expect an increased security presence and checkpoints. Curfews could be imposed at any point. Follow the instructions of local authorities in these regions.</p></span></div>
			<h3>Terrorism</h3>
			<p>There is a threat of terrorism. In 2018, terrorist groups have declared their intention to target Western companies in the Sahel. There have been multiple attacks in Ouagadougou and elsewhere in the country since 2016,including:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>On August 11, 2018, a landmine detonated under a National Gendarmerie convoy in the east of the country, 100 km from Fada N'Gourma. A shootout with a group of gunmen then took place. These incidents resulted in several victims;</li>
				<li>On March 2, 2018, attackers staged a double attack against Burkina Faso&rsquo;s armed forces and against the French embassy, killing at least 8 people and injuring many others</li>
				<li>On August 13, 2017, assailants shot at clients at Aziz-Istanbul restaurant, killing at least 18 people and injuring several more</li>
				<li>On January 15, 2016, gunmen stormed the Splendid Hotel and the Caf&eacute; Cappuccino, killing 30 people</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Further attacks cannot be ruled out. Targets could include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>government buildings, including schools</li>
				<li>places of worship</li>
				<li>extraction sites</li>
				<li>airports and other transportation hubs and networks</li>
				<li>public areas such as tourist attractions, restaurants, bars, coffee shops, shopping centres, markets, hotels and other sites frequented by foreigners</li>
			</ul>
			<p>During the attacks in 2016 and 2017, assailants specifically targeted establishments frequented by foreigners. If you are in Ouagadougou, avoid bars and restaurants that are mostly frequented by foreigners at peak hours.</p>
			<p>Always be aware of your surroundings when in public places.</p>
			<p>Stay at hotels that have robust security measures; however, keep in mind that even the most secure locations cannot be considered completely free of risk.</p>
			<h3>Political situation</h3>
			<p>In 2014, a popular uprising ousted the sitting president, and, in September 2015, there was a failed coup on the transitional government. The political situation has been stable since the November 2015 presidential elections.</p>
			<section class="alert alert-warning">
				<h3><p>Constitutional referendum and demonstrations</p></h3>
				<p>A constitutional referendum is due to take place on March 24, 2019. Demonstrations could occur before, during and after the referendum.</p>
			</section>
			<p>Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place</li>
				<li>Follow the instructions of local authorities</li>
				<li>Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations</li>
			</ul>
			<p><a href="http://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/mass-gatherings">More about mass gatherings (large-scale events)</a></p>
			<h3>Banditry</h3>
			<p>Incidents of illegal roadblocks and carjacking have occurred. Armed criminals don&rsquo;t hesitate to shoot at vehicles to stop and rob their occupants. &nbsp;The following regions are particularly prone to such incidents:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>eastern</li>
				<li>central</li>
				<li>east-central</li>
				<li>north-central</li>
				<li>central plateau</li>
			</ul>
			<p>However, such incidents can also happen in other areas, day or night, on both main and secondary roads.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>exercise caution at all times</li>
				<li>if possible, travel in a convoy</li>
				<li>avoid travelling during early morning hours and after sundown</li>
				<li>In the event that you are attacked, don&rsquo;t resist and contact the local authorities as soon as possible (Gendarmerie &ndash; num&eacute;ro vert 10 10)</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Crime&nbsp;</h3>
			<p>Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and purse snatching, occurs in major cities. In Ouagadougou, the areas around the United Nations roundabout and Central Market are often targeted by thieves. Petty crime occurs to a lesser degree elsewhere in the
				country.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Ensure that your personal belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, are secure at all times.</li>
				<li>Avoid showing signs of affluence and walking alone after dark.</li>
				<li>Always carry a legally certified photocopy of your passport&rsquo;s identification page.</li>
			</ul>
			<!-- START Road safety -->
			<h3>Road safety</h3>
			<p>Driving in Burkina Faso can be challenging. Roads are generally narrow, unpaved and poorly lit. Pedestrians, bicycles, carts, vehicles without headlights and potholes pose hazards to drivers. Many trucks transit the country at night. Travel after dark
				is not recommended.</p>
			<!-- END Road safety -->
			<h3>Public transportation</h3>
			<p>Public transportation is not recommended.</p>
			<h3>Air travel</h3>
