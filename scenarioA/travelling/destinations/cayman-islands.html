					<b>Exercise normal security precautions</b>
					<p>There are no significant safety and security concerns. The overall safety and security situation is similar to that of Canada. You should take normal security precautions.</p>
					<b>Exercise a high degree of caution</b>
					<p>There are identifiable safety and security concerns or the safety and security situation could change with little notice. You should exercise a high degree of caution at all times, monitor local media and follow the instructions of local authorities.</p>

						 <p><b>IMPORTANT:</b> The two levels below are official Government of Canada Travel Advisories and are issued when the safety and security of Canadians travelling or living in the country may be compromised.</p>
					</section>
					<b>Avoid non-essential travel</b>
					<p>There are specific safety and security concerns that could put you at risk. You should reconsider your need to travel to the country, territory or region. If you are already in the country, territory or region, you should reconsider whether or not you really need to be there. If not, you should consider leaving while it is still safe to do so. It is up to you to decide what &ldquo;non-essential travel&rdquo; means, based on family or business requirements, knowledge of or familiarity with a country, territory or region, and other factors.</p>
					<b>Avoid all travel</b>
					<p>There is an extreme risk to your personal safety and security. You should not travel to this country, territory or region. If you are already in the country, territory or region, you should consider leaving if it is safe to do so.</p>
