            <h2 id="security">Safety and security</h2>
                <h3>Crime</h3><p>Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and purse snatching, occurs. Increasingly, Canadians are victims of these crimes, especially in Havana.</p><p>Theft generally occurs in crowded places such as tourist areas, markets and beaches. Theft from hotel rooms, particularly in private accommodations (<i>casas particulares</i>), occurs. Theft from cars is also common.</p><p>Theft of items from checked baggage at Cuban airports occurs, whereby bags, including locked suitcases, are opened and items are removed. All bags are routinely X-rayed on arrival and departure as part of normal security procedures.</p><ul><li>Ensure that your personal belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, are secure at all times</li><li>Do not pack valuables in your checked luggage</li><li>Carry a photocopy of your passport&rsquo;s identification page at all times</li><li>Carry only small amounts of money</li><li>Avoid showing signs of affluence, such as flashy jewelry and watches</li><li>Never carry purses and bags loosely over one shoulder</li><li>Keep electronic devices like cellphones, tablets, laptops and cameras out of sight, as they are particularly attractive to thieves</li><li>Avoid independent street vendors</li><li>Never pick up hitchhikers</li><li>Be cautious when withdrawing cash from ATMs</li><li>Exchange currency in state-run exchange bureaus (<i>cadecas</i>)</li></ul><h4>Violent crime</h4><p>Incidents of violent crime are generally associated with assaults committed during a burglary or robbery.</p><p>Hustlers (<i>jineteros</i>) specialize in deceiving and defrauding tourists. Most swindlers speak some English or French and go out of their way to appear friendly, by offering to serve as tour guides or to facilitate the purchase of cigars. Many of them are criminals who may resort to violence in their efforts to steal tourists&rsquo; money and other valuables.</p><p>Individuals posing as bogus tour agents or taxi drivers operate throughout the country.</p><p>When reporting a crime to the local police, insist on receiving a <i>Comprobante de Denuncia</i>. This is a document confirming that a report has been filed. Police officers may speak only Spanish.</p><ul><li>If you are threatened by robbers, stay calm and do not resist</li><li>Use established tour operators and registered taxis</li></ul><h3>Women&rsquo;s safety</h3><p>Women travelling alone may be subject to some forms of harassment and verbal abuse. Some incidents of assault, rape and sexual aggression against Canadian women have also occurred, including at beach resorts.</p><p>Anyone who is a victim of a sexual assault should report it immediately to the nearest Canadian consulate or embassy and is strongly advised to file a report with Cuban authorities.</p><p><a href="https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/publications/her-own-way">Safe-travel guide for women</a></p><h3>Power outages</h3><p>Unscheduled electric power surges and outages are common. However, most tourist resorts are equipped with generators.</p><h3>Telecommunications networks</h3><p>Telecommunications system is antiquated and unreliable. Telephone communication is a problem.</p><p>Calls are often not answered, even at major institutions. Calls may be connected to a different number than the one dialled. It often takes repeated tries to place a call to another city.</p><p>Reliable cell phone service is available in most major cities. Canadian cell phones generally function.</p><h3>Demonstrations</h3><p>In Cuba, participating in demonstrations is illegal. They may take place from time to time.</p><p>Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.</p><ul><li>Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place</li><li>Follow the instructions of local authorities</li><li>Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations</li></ul><p><a href="http://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/mass-gatherings">More about mass gatherings (large-scale events)</a><span></span></p><!-- START Road safety --><h3>Road safety</h3><p>Motor vehicles accidents are now the leading cause of accidental death in Cuba.</p><p>Road conditions and road safety can vary greatly throughout the country. The principal east&ndash;west highways are in fair condition but lack sufficient lighting. Most secondary streets and roads are poorly lit and inadequately maintained. Road signs are scarce and confusing.</p><p>Most Cuban cars are old, in poor condition, and lack standard safety equipment. Some cars and most bicycles do not have running lights. Inoperable vehicles are often left on the road until repaired.</p><p>Pedestrians and horse-drawn carts use the middle of the road and don&rsquo;t readily give way to oncoming vehicles. Roaming animals pose a risk.</p><ul><li>Avoid driving in Cuba, as conditions can be hazardous;</li><li>If you must drive, do so defensively at all times.</li></ul><!-- END Road safety --><h3>Public transportation</h3><h4>Buses</h4><p>City buses are overcrowded and poorly maintained. Bus service is not reliable.</p><p>Tour companies offer good bus service between airports and the all-inclusive resorts. Buses used for organized day trips from hotels are usually in good condition.</p><h4>Taxis</h4><p>Official taxis are generally reliable.</p><p>Avoid unlicensed private taxis as well as old-model private vehicles offered as taxis. The latter are not equipped with standard safety features and there is no insurance coverage for passengers in case of an accident.</p><p>Yellow, three-wheeled Coco taxis are unsafe. You should avoid them.</p><h3>Air travel</h3><p>We do not make assessments on the compliance of foreign domestic airlines with international safety standards.</p><p><a href="http://travel.gc.ca/air/foreign-domestic-airlines">General information about foreign domestic airlines</a></p><h3>&nbsp;</h3>

Personal effects include new or used articles one might reasonably need for a holiday. Cuban customs officials may seize any imported item that they do not consider to be for the tourist&rsquo;s personal use and may apply steep tariffs for personal baggage exceeding 30 kg or 10 kg of medication.</p><h4>Cigars</h4><p>You may export up to 20 cigars from Cuba without documentation or up to 50 cigars if they are in their original container, closed and sealed with the official hologram. If exceeding these amounts, you must provide a guarantee of origin certificate. Failure to comply with this regulation will lead to the seizure of the cigars without compensation.</p><h4>Art objects</h4><p>Art objects, including artifacts and paintings, purchased in Cuba must be accompanied by an export permit. It is usually provided by state-owned galleries. Otherwise, items must be registered with the Registro Nacional de Bienes Culturales.</p><h4>Electronic devices</h4><p>All electronic devices with GPS technology are illegal and may be confiscated upon entry to Cuba.</p><p><a href="http://www.aduana.gob.cu/index.php/english">Cuban Customs Administration</a> - Cuban government</p><!-- END imports_and_exports --><!-- START black_market --><h3>Black market</h3><p>As a traveller, you may be approached and offered black-market goods, such as cigars, or asked to change dollars for Cuban pesos.</p><p>Engaging in black-market transactions is illegal and can lead to difficulties with the Cuban authorities.</p><ul><li>Never transport packages for strangers</li><li>Pack all luggage yourself</li></ul><!-- END black_market --><!-- START boat_traffic --><h3>Boat traffic</h3><p>The U.S. government closely monitors boat traffic in the Straits of Florida. It will seize any vessel not bearing a licence from the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) if it believes it is headed for Cuba.</p><p>Canadians who dock their Canadian-registered boats in Florida are subject to these measures. Canadian boats simply en route to Cuba via the U.S. will be exempt. However, expect to be thoroughly searched and questioned.</p><!-- END boat_traffic --><!-- START driving --><h3>Driving</h3><p>Penalties for drinking and driving are severe. The legal blood alcohol limit is 0.04 percent.</p><p>If you are found driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs, you will be subject to arrest and detention.</p><h4>Traffic accidents</h4><p>Traffic accidents are a frequent cause of arrest and detention of Canadians in Cuba.</p><p>Accidents resulting in death or injury are treated as crimes, and the onus is on the driver to prove innocence. If you are found to bear responsibility in a traffic accident resulting in serious injury or death, you are subject to prison terms of up to 10 years.</p><p>Regardless of the nature of the accident, it can take 5 months to a year for a case to go to trial. In most cases, you will not be allowed to leave Cuba until the trial has taken place. You may also be imprisoned during this delay.</p><h4>Vehicle rentals</h4><p>Be cautious if you rent a vehicle in Cuba. The insurance coverage differs from that in Canada.</p><p>Rental agencies are government-controlled. If you are found to be at fault in any way in an accident, the rental agency will nullify your coverage and seek damages to cover the cost of repairs. Cuban authorities can prohibit you from leaving the country unless the rental agency receives payment or until all claims associated with an accident are settled.</p><p>Contract agreements do not cover occasional drivers. Therefore, the signatory is responsible for all people driving the vehicle.</p><p>When returning a rented vehicle, make sure to obtain a receipt.</p><p>Avoid renting scooters. Thieves target them and you may be responsible for the cost of their replacement.</p><!-- END driving --><!-- START money --><h3>Money</h3><p>Cuba has 2 official currencies:</p><ul><li>the Cuban convertible peso (CUC)</li><li>the Cuban national peso (CUP), also known as <i>moneda nacional</i>)</li></ul><p>The CUC is worth substantially more than the CUP. Transactions involving foreigners almost always take place in CUCs.</p><p>It is a common scam for merchants to give change in CUP instead of CUC. Learn to differentiate between 2 currencies.</p><h4>Credit cards</h4><p>Credit cards issued by U.S. financial institutions or affiliated with U.S. banks, are not accepted in Cuba.</p><p>Other credit cards are generally accepted at major establishments and international resort chains. However, private restaurants (<i>paladares</i>) and private guest houses (<i>casas particulares</i>) do not accept credit cards of any kind.</p><p>Credit card cash advances, in CUCs, may be obtained at banks, hotels or a state-run <i>cadeca</i> (exchange house).</p><h4>Debit cards and ATMs</h4><p>Debit cards and money transfers are not widely accepted in Cuba. ATMs are rare and do not always work in Cuba.</p><h4>Foreign currencies</h4><p>Most foreign currencies can be exchanged at cadecas in Cuba&rsquo;s international airports as well as in banks and major hotels.</p><p>Canadian currency may be exchanged for CUC without fees. Exchange of U.S. currency is subject to a 10-percent fee.</p><p>It is illegal to remove CUCs from Cuba. They cannot be exchanged outside of Cuba. Exchange your CUCs at international airports before leaving the country.</p><!-- END money -->
