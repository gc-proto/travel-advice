			<h2>Safety and security</h2>
			<h3>Region beyond Yaviza</h3><p>Avoid all travel between Yaviza and the Colombian border. Colombian guerrilla groups and drug traffickers are present&nbsp;in this area. The level of violent crime in this zone is extremely high, with numerous reports of kidnappings, armed robberies, deaths and disappearances.</p><p>The area spans beyond the town of Yaviza in Dari&eacute;n Province to the Colombian border. It begins at the end of the Pan-American Highway (past Yaviza, about 230 km southeast of Panama City) and ends at the Colombian border. It also includes parts of Dari&eacute;n National Park and privately owned nature reserves and tourist resorts.</p><p>If you choose to visit this region despite this advisory: &nbsp;</p><ul><li>be extremely vigilant at all times</li><li>review your security situation regularly</li><li>leave a detailed itinerary with family or friends</li></ul><h3>Crime</h3><p>Violent crime is not frequent, but does occur in Panama. Petty theft&nbsp;occurs in rural and urban areas throughout the country. Both have been reported in areas frequented by tourists.</p><p>In Panama City, high-crime areas include bus stations and shopping areas on Avenida Central as well as the following neighborhoods:</p><ul><li>Anc&oacute;n</li><li>Calidonia</li><li>Curund&uacute;</li><li>El Chorillo</li><li>San Miguelito</li><li>Juan Diaz</li><li>Parque Soberania</li><li>Rio Abajo</li><li>Tocumen</li><li>Veracruz Beach</li></ul><p>There have been violent crimes in the cities of Col&oacute;n and David, also, and in some beach communities. Theft from hotel rooms occurs in both urban and resort areas. Stay in busy, reputable and well-protected hotels and always verify the identity of a visitor before opening your door. Ensure that your personal belongings, and passports and other travel documents, are secure at all times.</p><p>Avoid displaying signs of affluence or carrying large sums of cash and be cautious when withdrawing money from ATMs. Ensure that windows and doors are secure and locked in both private and commercial accommodations.</p><p>Do not walk alone after dark. Remain vigilant in all public places, especially at airports and bus terminals.<b>&nbsp;</b></p><h3>Demonstrations</h3><p>Demonstrations occasionally occur. Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation.</p><ul><li>Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place</li><li>Follow the instructions of local authorities</li><li>Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations</li></ul><p><a href="http://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/mass-gatherings">More about mass gatherings (large-scale events)</a><span></span></p><!-- START Road safety --><h3>Road safety</h3><p>Road conditions and road safety are poor throughout the country. Drivers often drive dangerously. Keep car windows closed and doors locked at all times.</p><p>Night construction on the Pan-American Highway is frequent. Be prepared for possible roadblocks.</p><!-- END Road safety --><h3>Public transportation</h3><p>Local bus travel within Panama City has improved in recent years, but buses don&rsquo;t always follow a regular route. When using public transportation, be aware of your surroundings and protect your belongings.</p><p>Registered yellow taxis are generally safe if located at a taxi stand. They are not metered, and fares are calculated according to the number of zones crossed to get to a destination.</p><ul><li>Agree to a fare before departure</li><li>Don&rsquo;t share a taxi with strangers</li><li>Always sit in the back of the vehicle</li></ul><h3>Marine transportation</h3><p>The southeastern coast of Comarca Kuna Yala, Coiba Island and the entire length of the Pacific coast are known as transportation corridors for narcotics.</p><h3>Swimming</h3><p>Coastal waters can be dangerous on both the Pacific and Caribbean coasts. Currents are strong and riptides are common. Drownings have occurred. Most beaches lack sufficient rescue equipment and are not adequately monitored or marked.</p><p><a href="http://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/water-safety">Water safety abroad</a></p><h3>Air travel</h3><p>We do not make assessments on the compliance of foreign domestic airlines with international safety standards.</p><p><a href="http://travel.gc.ca/air/foreign-domestic-airlines">General information about foreign domestic airlines</a></p><h3>&nbsp;</h3>
