<p>NARRATOR: How many bags can you take on your trip… without having to pay extra fees, that is.</p>
<p>And what happens if the airline loses your bags?</p>
<p>The answers to these questions depend on the airline you're flying with.</p>
<p>It's important to be aware of its terms and conditions relating to baggage limits, fees and compensation for lost, delayed or damaged bags, especially now that many airlines charge for checked baggage or they limit the number of bags that you may carry on board.</p>
<p>So where do you find out about an airline's baggage policy?</p>
<p>You can give them a call, visit their ticket counter or go to their website. Each airline lists its terms and conditions of carriage in a document called their "tariff". It is your contract with the airline.</p>
<p>You'll find information on how many bags you can check-in or bring into the cabin as carry-on.</p>
<p>Remember that allowable weight, size and any fees for extra bags can vary from airline to airline.</p>
<p>Compensation amounts for lost, delayed or damaged bags are also listed in airlines' tariffs.</p>
<p>Remember:</p>
<ul>
<li>always keep your receipts for replacement items;</li>
<li>there is a maximum to how much an airline will compensate you; and</li>
<li>there is a time limit to file your claim.</li>
</ul>
<p>When in doubt, contact your airline or check out your airline's tariff before your trip.</p>
<p>The Canadian Transportation Agency also provides resources that can help.</p>
<p>Fly Smart. Know Your Rights &amp; Responsibilities.</p>

		<h2 class="h3"><a name="electronic"></a>Portable electronic devices</h2>
		<p>Some airline operators may allow you to use approved portable electronic devices such as cameras, tablets, gaming consoles, laptop  computers, e-readers and camcorders on board the aircraft from gate to gate,  including during takeoff and landing, as long as they are in non-transmitting mode  or flight mode. Cellphones are also considered electronic devices, but once the  aircraft is in motion prior to take off, you can&rsquo;t make cellphone calls or send  and receive wireless signals. </p>
		<p>Always check with  the airline before you travel or with a crew member after you board the  aircraft before using a portable electronic device during the flight. Some  devices are strictly prohibited for use at any time because they can interfere with the aircraft's navigation and communication systems. Carry-on baggage rules apply to devices such as laptop computers, which must be stowed or secured for takeoff and landing. </p>
		<p>		  You are not allowed to use personal devices with headsets or earphones  during takeoff, landing, and turbulence or while walking on the airport apron.  Headsets and earphones decrease your ability to hear crew member instructions,  especially during an emergency, and decrease your awareness of potential  hazards on the airport apron.</p>
